My name is Zachary Jones and I aim to be as well rounded of a programmer as I can. I am passionate and focused on web development however, I have a wide range of technical and engineering interests that I pursue in my spare time. I began my computer science education in my last year of high school in an Intro to Game Development course. There I learned about the basics of C and C++ and over the year long class I found my passion for programming. After highschool I started at Bellevue College in Washington state and earned credits I was planning on transfering into a CS degree. I was however fortunate enough to become roomates with an awesome technical mentor. He had been programming from a very young age and offered to sponsor me for three months to learn Ruby on Rails so that I could start accomplishing my goals as a programmer without huge student debt.  I still plan on returning to school for a legitimate CS degree however I will do so as an established web developer so that I do not have to take out huge debt. He taught me the power of self education and for three months I learned as much as I could and then went to work freelancing with him and a few other roomates. After a great and exciting year full of hackathons and a few small to medium size projects, I decided to take the leap and make web development my main career focus. Since I have worked as a Ruby on Rails Developer for a couple start-ups and have come a long way since my web engineering education started at the end of 2011.
